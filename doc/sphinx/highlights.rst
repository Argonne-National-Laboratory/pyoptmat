pyoptmat features
=================

- A complete open source solution for training statistical, ODE models against 
  uncertain data.
- Efficient backward pass/gradient calculation using the adjoint method.  This
  approach vastly outperforms automatic differentiation for time series data. 
- Implicit time integration algorithms suitable for material models represents
  as stiff systems of ordinary differential equations.
- Prebuilt model components aimed at high temperature structural materials.
- An abstraction that makes it easy to train both deterministic and statistical
  models, starting from the same base material model form.
- Examples and tests to help you get started.
