# pyoptmat: a package for calibrating statistical constitutive models

pyoptmat is a package for calibrating statistical, inelastic constitutive 
models to data.  The package is based on [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
and [pyro](https://pyro.ai/) and provides a framework for using machine-learning
techniques to calibrate deterministic and statistical models against
experimental data.

directory contains several examples using synthetically-generated data.
